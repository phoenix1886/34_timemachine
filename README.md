# Timer for Websites That Steal Your Time

This project helps to control time was spent on sites. It requires special extension for Chrome browser.

# Installing

Install extension for Chrome browser [Custom JavaScript for websites](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija).

Open configuration of [cjs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) browser extension on the site you want to controll. Click on the link "your own external scripts", add path https://cdn.rawgit.com/phoenix1886/34_timemachine/d652666f/index.js . Don`t forget to press "enable cjs for this host" to enable custom JS.

After that, timer will appear in the left top corner. It starts at 3 minutes. When 3 minutes are gone script gives notification and starts new 30 seconds round. It will work perpetually, giving notifications every 30 seconds till user quits the site.

For faster development you can use JS code hosted on localhost. Simple web server can be used for that, run:

```bash

python3 -m http.server
```

Add path `http://localhost:8000/index.js` to [cjs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) browser extension. Done.
